# Claude Code Instructions

## Package Manager

This project uses **Bun** as the package manager and runtime.

- Use `bun install` to install dependencies
- Use `bun run <script>` to run scripts (e.g., `bun run dev`, `bun run build`)
- Use `bun run test:run` to run tests (Vitest)
- Do not use npm, yarn, or `bun test` (which runs Bun's native test runner)
